/**
 * @brief Initializer for visual-inertial system.
 *
 * This will try to do both dynamic and state initialization of the state.
 * The user can request to wait for a jump in our IMU readings (i.e. device is picked up) or to initialize as soon as possible.
 * For state initialization, the user needs to specify the calibration beforehand, otherwise dynamic is always used.
 * The logic is as follows:
 * 1. Try to perform dynamic initialization of state elements.
 * 2. If this fails and we have calibration then we can try to do static initialization
 * 3. If the unit is stationary and we are waiting for a jerk, just return, otherwise initialize the state!
 *
 * The dynamic system is based on an implementation and extension of the work [Estimator initialization in vision-aided inertial navigation
 * with unknown camera-IMU calibration](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6386235) @cite Dong2012IROS which solves the initialization
 * problem by first creating a linear system for recovering the camera to IMU rotation, then for velocity, gravity, and feature positions,
 * and finally a full optimization to allow for covariance recovery.
 * Another paper which might be of interest to the reader is [An Analytical Solution to the IMU Initialization
 * Problem for Visual-Inertial Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9462400) which has some detailed
 * experiments on scale recovery and the accelerometer bias.
