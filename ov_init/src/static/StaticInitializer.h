 * 1. Collect all inertial measurements
 * 2. See if within the last window there was a jump in acceleration
 * 3. If the jump is past our threshold we should init (i.e. we have started moving)
 * 4. Use the *previous* window, which should have been stationary to initialize orientation
 * 5. Return a roll and pitch aligned with gravity and biases.

   * This will check if we have had a large enough jump in our acceleration.
   * If we have then we will use the period of time before this jump to initialize the state.
   * This assumes that our imu is sitting still and is not moving (so this would fail if we are experiencing constant acceleration).
   *
   * In the case that we do not wait for a jump (i.e. `wait_for_jerk` is false), then the system will try to initialize as soon as possible.
   * This is only recommended if you have zero velocity update enabled to handle the stationary cases.
