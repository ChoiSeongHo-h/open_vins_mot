@page dev-ros1-to-ros2 ROS1 to ROS2 Bag Conversion Guide



@section gs-ros1-to-ros2-option-1 rosbags

[rosbags](https://gitlab.com/ternaris/rosbags) is the simplest utility which does not depend on ROS installs at all.
ROS bag conversion is a hard problem since you need to have both ROS1 and ROS2 dependencies.
This is what was used to generate the converted ROS2 bag files for standard datasets.
To do a conversion of a bag file we can do the following:

@code{.shell-session}
pip install rosbags
rosbags-convert V1_01_easy.bag
@endcode




@section dev-ros1-to-ros2-option-2 rosbag2 play

To do this conversion you will need to have both ROS1 and ROS2 installed on your system.
Also ensure that you have installed all dependencies and backends required.
The main [rosbag2](https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2) readme has a lot of good details.

@code{.shell-session}
sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS2_DISTRO-ros2bag ros-$ROS2_DISTRO-rosbag2*
sudo apt install ros-$ROS2_DISTRO-rosbag2-bag-v2-plugins
@endcode

From here we can do the following.
This is based on [this issue](https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/issues/139#issuecomment-516167831).
You might run into issues with the .so files being corrupted (see [this issue](https://github.com/ros2/rosbag2/issues/94))
Not sure if there is a fix besides building it from scratch yourself.

@code{.shell-session}
source_ros1
source_ros2
ros2 bag play -s rosbag_v2 V1_01_easy.bag
@endcode
